### How to Set Up Environment

```
poetry install
poetry env activate
```

See [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for how to install poetry.

As a fallback you may use:
```
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you are done working (either workflow) use:
`deactivate`
